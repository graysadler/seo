Part of the reason that a woman is attracted to a particular man is because he has characteristics that make her feel safe – that she’s going to be taken care of. These characteristics can fuzz out other elements of his personality.</p>
<p>As the relationship deepens and she gets to know him better she’ll see past that initial image to the real, full person that he is. She might then find what she considers flaws and she’ll comment on them hoping to fix him.</p>
<p><strong>How Women Criticize</strong></p>
<p>When women meet and one thinks that the other looks great in the color she’s wearing, she’ll compliment her and say something like: “You look so great in pink.” The woman in pink then feels uplifted and more confident with herself.</p>
<p>But if she finds something distasteful about what her friend is wearing, and she cares about that particular friend, she’ll tell her softly, “Susie, really? You know pink doesn’t really work with your coloring.”</p>
<p>From that point on Susie might never wear pink again. Certainly not around that friend.</p>
<p>This is one of the ways that woman communicate. They express how much they care about each other by helping each other improve. And since they all talk that language, they also understand the meaning behind comments like these.</p>
<p>Now the problems arise when a man does something that the woman in his life finds annoying.</p>
<p>Let’s say that the guy has a particular shirt that he enjoys wearing. A brown, hideous looking thing. He doesn’t care how it looks – it’s comfortable and it makes him feel rugged.</p>
<p>His wife however has different ideas.</p>
<p>The first time she sees him wear it she doesn’t mention it. She figures it was the last clean thing in his wardrobe and he wanted to wear something that smelled clean for her.</p>
<p>But then he wears it again. And again.</p>
<p>So she says to him, “Honey that’s not the most flattering shirt.”</p>
<p>She’s assuming that he’ll react like a woman… the shirt will disappear and she’ll never see it again.</p>
<p>But he’s not a woman. And he doesn’t realize that the comment or “suggestion” was really a direct order for him to follow.</p>
<p>In his mind, he’ll evaluate what she said. If he agrees that the shirt has gone out of style he’ll get rid of it. But if he decides that he likes the shirt anyway, he’ll mentally thank her for the suggestion and will continue wearing it.</p>
<p>Now she is confused, and thinks that perhaps he didn’t hear her. So she’ll say it again.</p>
<p>But eventually it becomes clear that he does hear her, and she’ll start getting mad. If a woman friend was defying her “improvement suggestions” so blatantly, that would be considered an offense to the relationship.</p>
<p>But since a man isn’t fluent in the indirect language of women the comment at face value and responds accordingly. Eventually, her comments will be perceived as nagging.</p>
<p>This form of communication leads to a dead-end.</p>
<p>He’s not going to change that way – in fact that’s the worst way to change a man.</p>
<p>But there is a very different way that a woman can convey her feelings. She’ll be able to get exactly what she wants and at the same time strengthen their relationship.</p>
<p>The key is to understand the logical, direct way that men communicate. Instead of spending time and energy on hints that he won’t get anyway, she should tell him straight out what she wants. She should give him clear instructions on how to make her happy.</p>
<p>In our example, she could say the following: “Honey, I really don’t like that shirt on you. I want to spend time with you, but I feel embarrassed when you wear that shirt. Maybe we could go buy you a new shirt – something that we’ll both enjoy.”</p>
<p>If a man were to hear that, the shirt will be incinerated before you know it.</p>
<p><strong>Empowering Your Man</strong></p>
<p>If a woman can learn that simple tactic – if she can convert the hinting into a clear statement about how she feels or what she wants – many arguments and misunderstandings can be avoided.</p>
<p>Men have a natural desire to give. Women can make it easier for them by clearly saying what it is that they want, without hints. If they do that they will experience the overflowing giving that men have.</p>
<p>Once she understands how she can empower him – and help him in his desire to give to her – their relationship will be transformed.</p>
